Output a randomly chosen poem by emily dickinson. Poems were retrieved from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12242). Optionally download and parse the poems straight from the source!

To print a poem, add the `--print` flag to `main.py`!
```shell
$ python3 withfeathers/withfeathers.py --print --decorate --time

XXXVII.

VOID.

Great streets of silence led away
To neighborhoods of pause;
Here was no notice, no dissent,
No universe, no laws.

By clocks 't was morning, and for night
The bells at distance called;
But epoch had no basis here,
For period exhaled.

A really good **R implementation** (and inspiration for this program) is this one! -> [Display a random Emily Dickinson poem (Gutenberg edition)](https://r.amherst.edu/apps/nhorton/Dickinson1/)

# Documentation

Poems will be downloaded into a file (e.g. `pg12242.txt`) in `main.py`'s working directory. The file will then be parsed into individual poem files into a directory (e.g. `emilyPoems`), from which random poems will be selected.

`python main.py --help` will print all options accepted by `main.py`.

```shell
$ python withfeathers/main.py --help
usage: main.py [-h] [-c] [-d] [-f FILENAME] [-o OUTPUTDIR] [-p] [-r] [-t]
               [-u URL] [-v]
